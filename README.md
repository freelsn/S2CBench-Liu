# DARCLAB S2CBench benchmark suite

The benchmark suite is designed for the purpose of high-level-synthesis related research. The benchmarks are written in SystemC for maximum compatibility and are in a single-file fashion for easy movement.

The benchmark suite is actively under the development of [DARCLAB](http://www.utdallas.edu/~schaferb/darclab/index.html).
